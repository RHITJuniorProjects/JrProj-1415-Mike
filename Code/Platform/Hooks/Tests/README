First, you need to place a test file in the same folder as the script to test.
Most likely, you will just want to grab the Unix commit.py file.

cp ../Unix/henry/commit.py ./

Then you can run these tests can be run as

python -m unittest commit-msg_T

You might need the unittest module if you don't already have it.
You can probably get that (although I haven't tried it) with 

pip install unittest
