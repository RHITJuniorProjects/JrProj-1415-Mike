Gamefication proposal:
The general concept is that there is a leaderboard page, which displays the relative standing of every member.
This can either be set to be anonymous or not at the discretion of the project lead. The rankings could be based off of
the bounties that could be placed on individual tasks, or/and as well as being based off of other metrics. By making which
metrics the points are based off of the project lead has a lot of control, and can encourage developers to focus on 
certain metrics. Also by showing developers how they stand in relatoin to their peers, it will encourage them to push to be
number one.
