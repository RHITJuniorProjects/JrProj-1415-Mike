These are instructions for getting code coverage numbers for your iOS project.

The tool that we're going to be using is called "frankencover.it".

First we need to run the commands "brew install groovy" and "brew install lcov" to get the software needed
Next we need to configure our App to generate the correct files for frankencover.it to interpret.
Set the main app target to produce test coverage output in debug mode and to instrument program flow in debug mode

Now build the application.
Once the build is finished open up a terminal and run the command: "groovy http://frankencover.it/with -source-dir <filepath to 
project>"

This will generate output that looks like this: http://imgur.com/QTiHN93
